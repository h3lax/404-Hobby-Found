"Create a visually appealing and minimalistic thumbnail for a university club. The style should be clean, modern, and slightly abstract, using bold lines and flat design. The color palette should be soft and cohesive, with a dominant main color and complementary tones. The background should be simple with subtle gradients or shapes. For the {clubTitre} club, include a central icon or symbol representing the club's focus, designed in the same flat and modern style. Avoid overly complex details, and ensure the overall aesthetic is consistent across thumbnails for various clubs."
